# homebrew

## Overview

This script installs Homebrew on a Linux system. Homebrew is a popular package manager that simplifies the installation and management of software on Unix-like operating systems. This customized version of the Homebrew installation script is configured to install everything under the `/home/versbottomlex/.dev/lib/brew` directory. 

> **Note:** This script is intended for personal use and is currently in the testing phase.

## Script Details

The script performs the following tasks:

1. **System Compatibility Check**: Ensures that the script is being run on a supported operating system (macOS or Linux) and checks for necessary permissions and configurations.

2. **Non-Interactive Mode Detection**: Configures the script to run non-interactively if required, which is useful for CI/CD environments.

3. **User and Group Setup**: Determines the current user and group to set appropriate permissions for the installation directories.

4. **Directory Creation and Permissions**: Creates necessary directories under `/home/versbottomlex/.dev/lib/brew` and sets the appropriate permissions. These directories include:
    - `/home/versbottomlex/.dev/lib/brew/bin`
    - `/home/versbottomlex/.dev/lib/brew/etc`
    - `/home/versbottomlex/.dev/lib/brew/include`
    - `/home/versbottomlex/.dev/lib/brew/lib`
    - `/home/versbottomlex/.dev/lib/brew/sbin`
    - `/home/versbottomlex/.dev/lib/brew/share`
    - `/home/versbottomlex/.dev/lib/brew/var`
    - `/home/versbottomlex/.dev/lib/brew/opt`
    - `/home/versbottomlex/.dev/lib/brew/share/zsh`
    - `/home/versbottomlex/.dev/lib/brew/share/zsh/site-functions`
    - `/home/versbottomlex/.dev/lib/brew/var/homebrew`
    - `/home/versbottomlex/.dev/lib/brew/var/homebrew/linked`
    - `/home/versbottomlex/.dev/lib/brew/Cellar`
    - `/home/versbottomlex/.dev/lib/brew/Caskroom`
    - `/home/versbottomlex/.dev/lib/brew/Frameworks`

5. **Sudo Access**: Checks for sudo access to perform actions that require elevated privileges.

6. **Command Line Tools Installation**: Installs necessary command line tools if they are not already present.

7. **Git and Curl Verification**: Ensures that the required versions of Git and cURL are installed.

8. **Homebrew Repository Setup**: Clones the Homebrew repository into the designated directory and sets up the Homebrew environment.

9. **Post-Installation Configuration**: Provides instructions for adding Homebrew to your systemâ€™s PATH and other environment variables.
